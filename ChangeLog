0.7.1  Mon May 19 14:00:25 PDT 2003  David Pritchard

- Implemented adaptive timestepping.
- Demo application: better automation, via command-line parameters, batch mode,
  and statistics files.
- Implemented Ascher & Boxerman's paper, improving performance of core
  algorithm.
- Optimised force calculation.


0.7.0  Wed Apr 23 13:41:41 PDT 2003  David Pritchard

- Migrated away from Boost+uBLAS to custom sparse matrix classes.
- Fixed final major bugs in simulation algorithm: dC_dt calculation and
  scale invariance problems.
- Added Doxygen-based documentation.
- Added air drag forces.
- Visuals: added texture filtering, antialiased border.
- General sourcecode cleanups.
- Demo application: better interactive behaviour, no more lockups.


0.6.0  Fri Sep 20 13:12:25 PDT 2002  David Pritchard

- Third release.
- Implemented modified conjugate gradient algorithm described by Baraff &
  Witkin, for a major speed improvement.
- Switched from dense matrices to sparse matrices, for another big speed
  improvement, and a big memory improvement.
- Switched from matrix-of-floats to matrix-of-3x3-matrices, for another big
  speed improvement.
- Changed default settings: stretch and shear forces are much stronger.
- Visuals: added textured cloth, fog. Fixed some lighting bugs.


0.5.1  Thu Aug 22 00:02:17 PDT 2002  David Pritchard

- Second release. Migrated from MTL to Boost+uBLAS for main matrix resolution,
  and from MTL to homegrown matrices for setup of main matrix. Ported to
  Windows, compiled under Visual C++ 6.0 successfully.


0.5.0  Mon May 27 23:08:12 PDT 2002  David Pritchard

- Initial public release. Matrices essentially set up, but matrix solution is
  not done with preconditioned conjugate gradient method yet. No collision
  detection, no air drag forces.
